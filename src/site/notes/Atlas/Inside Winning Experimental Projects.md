### Principles for Selling Experiential Projects

1. **Client Empathy**
    
    - Meet clients where they are - avoid technical jargon
    - Make complex ideas easy to understand
    - Use visualization tools like VR to help clients experience concepts
2. **Research and Profiling**
    
    - Understand client's tastes, desires, and values
    - Target projects to people based on their interests
    - Recognize that art is a luxury, not a necessity
3. **Immersive Alignment**
    
    - Create a "single source of truth" for all stakeholders
    - Align everyone around one vision as projects grow in scale
    - Provide visual tools everyone can understand

## Insights & Reflections

- Experiential projects require both creative vision and business understanding
- Visual communication is essential for complex, ambitious projects
- Technical skills (architecture, rendering, programming) can be combined to create unique professional value
- Understanding client values and needs is as important as creative excellence
- Remote collaboration tools are essential for creative project development

## Quotes

"The greater the ambition, the more work you have to do to meet the client where they are and give them the tools to understand it intuitively."

"Creative people were the first people laid off [during the pandemic]... I felt that creative people couldn't work remotely necessarily."

"How can I help make more [experiential projects] in the world? And how can I make the experience of making the experiences better as well?"
