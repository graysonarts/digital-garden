## How to Design Your Life: A 3-Part Process for Achieving Goals

Alex Hein, author of "Master of the Day," shares his systematic approach to consciously designing and creating the life you want, based on a coaching client's observation that successful people don't achieve their goals by accident.

### The Problem

Most people wake up at 20, 30, 40, or 50 years old realizing they don't know how they got where they are, and it's definitely not where they wanted to be. They lack conscious direction and design in their lives.

### The 3-Part Framework:

**Part 1: Vision/Design** Just sitting down for a day with coffee and writing "what would be the coolest thing that could happen over the next five years" puts you ahead of 99% of humanity who have no game plan or vision.

**Tools for Vision:**

- **Yearly Envisioning Document**: Write down the perfect year with no limitations, keep it on your desk, review twice daily. Include daily habits, quarterly projects, and areas for self-improvement.
- **Pocket Journal**: 3x5 moleskin to capture ideas, intuitive hunches, and "wouldn't it be cool to..." thoughts from conversations, books, and podcasts.
- **Weekly Strategy Page**: Reflect on where you are, where you want to be, and whether your daily habits are sufficient to get you there.
- **"Five Years from Today" Digital Document**: Long-term direction setting (could be moving locations, relationship goals, career objectives, lifestyle targets like "three vacations per year").

**Part 2: Daily Habits** Transform goals into daily actionable habits:

- Weight loss goal â†’ Cook every day, gym 20 minutes daily
- Write a book â†’ Write 500 words daily
- Amazing relationship â†’ Attend 4 social events monthly to meet like-minded people

**Tracking System:**

- Maximum 3 goals per year
- Maximum 3 habits per goal
- Weekly scorecard tracking Monday-Sunday completion
- Thursday mastermind calls (30-45 minutes) for accountability and reporting

**Part 3: Follow-Through & Course Correction**

- **Daily tracking**: Evening reflection on habit completion and areas for improvement
- **Weekly mastermind**: Group accountability calls to report progress percentages and challenges
- **Intuition logging**: Record gut feelings about when something doesn't feel right or needs to change
- **Systematic exploration**: Regularly review intuitive impressions to understand what's behind them

### Key Success Factors:

- **Conscious creation**: Everything starts as a vision (skyscrapers, spaceships, disease cures all began as pictures in someone's head)
- **Regular review**: Consistent checking in with your vision and progress
- **Accountability**: External support through mastermind groups
- **Flexibility**: Being open to pivoting when intuition signals something isn't right

Alex credits this systematic approach for transforming his life from ages 26-30, going from being an average student who hadn't accomplished much to becoming highly productive and contributing meaningfully to the world.
