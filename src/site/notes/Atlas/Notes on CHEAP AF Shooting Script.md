# SCENE Notes
3 - \[All text in brackets are meant to be broken English] - It's just a weird way of phrasing. \[All text in brackets in broken English]

5 - "One girl SQUEAKS". it's unclear if the girl squeaks with her voice, or if the squeaking is from the plastic-covered couch.

5A - Carol's VO is a bit on the nose. PITCH: "But let bygones be bygones. No one should lose their home.". Most people hate when bad things happen, so I don't think it's necessary to state it.

5C - Carol's VO feels stilted in this section

9, page 10, Carol says that Rachel always had the friends and attention, but in the opening scenes it seems like Carol is leading, especially in the car scene with Carol's snarky "Coming, Rachel" line.

21 - Might want to tweak the joke because this is basically the Mean Girl's halloween scene. What could you do to make it more unique?

Page 33 - Missing Scene number - "Is that store going out of business or something?". This exchange has happened previously. Mistake? Might be better to have him say "Another sale?" to call back to the previous time

71 - Still mention the Picnic Basket instead of the Castle

86 - Argument seems to resolve too quickly. I think Rachel would be angrier and take longer to get over it
