This page helps me track my own personal commitment to fitness and nutrition. It's a combination of journal and operating manual.
# Foundational Maxims

## Nutrition
1. I base the majority of my food on whole foods.
2. I allow myself to enjoy "treat" foods in moderation.
3. I support my activity by eating enough food, but not too much.
4. I experience my foods fully and mindfully.
## Exercise
1. I move my body at least 30 minutes every day.
2. I lift heavy things on a regular basis to allow me to do other activities with ease.
3. I value flexibility and stretch on a regular basis.
## Mental
1. I journal daily to get my mind organized.
2. I unplug an hour before bed and spend some of that meditating.
3. I manage my stress by taking time out of the day for mindfulness on regular intervals, even if just for a minute.
