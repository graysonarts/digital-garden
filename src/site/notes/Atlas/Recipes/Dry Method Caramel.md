Ratio of acid to sugar: 1:80

To invert the sugar, you need an acid. I use lemon juice. This is optional, but makes a more stable caramel.

1. Add the required amount of sugar to the saucier pan
2. Shake the pan to evenly distribute the sugar
3. Sprinkle the acid on the sugar and rub it in
4. Cook, without stirring over medium-low heat until the sugar melts and starts to brown
5. Once the sugar starts to caramelize around the edges, bring the melted and browned sugar to the center of the pan.
6. Repeat the above steps until all of the sugar has melted, trying not to stir too vigorously
7. Once dissolved fully, cook the caramel until you get the color you desire. No need to stir at this point, but pay attention so it doesn't burn
8. Once at the color you want, either dunk the bottom of the pan in water to stop the cooking, or add to cream, depending on what you are making.
9. Don't cool the caramel too much, or it will harden in the pan
