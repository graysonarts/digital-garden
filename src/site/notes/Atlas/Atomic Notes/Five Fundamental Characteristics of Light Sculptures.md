## Five Fundamental Characteristics

### 1. Light as Primary Medium

Light isn't just used to highlight an existing object. Light is the object.
### 2. Sculptural Presence

Either a literal sculpture that emits light, _or_ using light, color, and shadow to sculpt space into an object.
### 3. Spatial Transformation

Light Sculptures do not merely occupy a space. It's essential that they actively construct the space around them.
### 4. Perception is the subject

Provide meaning and existence through perception. Like a mirror, light sculptures encourage viewer participation. Through the act of perceiving, meaning is created, so in a way, it's shining a light on the way we perceive. (excuse the pun)
### 5. Temporal

Time is an important dimension for light sculptures. The time scale (seconds through years) is an important axis of design for a light sculpture.
