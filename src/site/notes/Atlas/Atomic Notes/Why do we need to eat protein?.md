# [[Atlas/Atomic Notes/Why do we need to eat protein?\|Why do we need to eat protein?]]

Our bodies cannot store amino acids, so we need to either make them from molecules through chemical reactions, or modify existing amino acids to create the needed amino acids. Because we can't store them, we need to get the building blocks from continually eating food.

There are nine amino acids that cannot be created by our body, so we must eat those. These are known as essential amino acids.
