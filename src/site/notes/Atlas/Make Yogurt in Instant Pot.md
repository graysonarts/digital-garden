1. Thoroughly clean Instant Pot, and use a dedicated gasket for yogurt making (I use the blue ring)
2. 8 cups of milk (or more), use the yogurt boil setting, get milk to 180F
3. Remove insert and cool at room temperature until it reaches 110F
4. Take 1 cup of warmed milk and mix with ~2 tablespoons of starter yogurt, whisk together, add 1 teaspoon of vanilla if using.
5. Add flavored yogurt mixture back to main pot
6. Culture the Yogurt for 6-10 hours using the yogurt low setting.
7. Cool overnight.
8. Strain if desired.
