# I have too many things to 3D Print!

**Problem**: I have too many projects that require my 3D printer, and I bounce between the jobs too often and never finish longer form projects that are "nice to haves" so this page is an attempt for me to organize what needs to be done, what stage things are at, and prioritize the printer.

Technically I have 3 printers, but I only use one of them, my [[Anycubic Kobra 3 Max\|Anycubic Kobra 3 Max]].

### Underware 2.0 cable management for my desk
_status: printing_

I recently moved my standing desk out of the little closet that it was in, into my bedroom. I'm spending more of my time at my boyfriend's condo, so I'm treating my condo as a workspace more than anything now.

But I hate cables, but have never prioritized making the closet look nice. Now that the desk is more visible, I'm printing Underware 2.0 to organize my cables, and then will print a wire spline to control the couple of cables that need to go down to the floor.

### Portable Electronics Kit
_status: designing_

I have an old pelican case that I'm going to repurpose to an on-location soldering station. Here is everything (affiliate links coming soon) that I want to include in my soldering station, and I need to design parts to keep everything in it's place.

- Mini project power supply
- Pinecil portable soldering iron
- Solder stand with gold scrunchy thing
- Magnetic magic arms for soldering
- Portable fume extractor
- Solder
- Flux
- Mini breadboard
- Jumpers
- Logic Analyzer
- Mini Oscilloscope 
- PD USB adapter + USB-C cable

The power supply came with a handy case and I'm planning to print something that goes in that case and keeps the soldering iron and power supply in place. Then that case can go into the kit.

Additionally, I need a bin for storing extra parts that can rotate depending on the project.

### Camera Gear Tool Chest Organization
_status: planning_

I'm using gridfinity, so I'm printing base plates to fill up every drawer, and then from there, I need to plan out the parts, design some custom-"molded" holders and the like.

I have a US. General tool chest that I bought from Harbor Freight, and I need to kit that out to organize all my camera gear. Batteries, mounts, audio gear, gimbals, it's all a huge mess right now, and I need to organize it.
