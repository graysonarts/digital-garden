# Loading and Performance

- 3 axes of rotation
	- Roll is tilting left and right
		- Aeleron. On a quad, right stick left and right
	- Pitch is tilting up and down
		- Elevator. On a quad, right stick up and down
	- Yaw is panning left and right
		- Rudder. On a quad, left stick left and right
	Power on a quad is left stick up and down, and that controls elevation
		For fixed wing, power is forward thrust
* Flight Forces
	* Summary of Forces
		* Fixed Wing
			* Lift is force applying "up" on the aircraft
			* Weight is the force applying "down". gravity
			* Thrust is force created by the primary engine. Prop or Jet
			* Drag is wind resistance opposite thrust
		* Quad (rotorcraft)
			* Lift is created by the motors
			* Weight is gravity
			* Thrust is when we tilt the quad in a direction, thrust is created in that direction
			* Drag is wind resistance opposite thrust
	* Forces
		* Lift
			* Quad - Produced by the motors
			* Fixed - created by the wing (airfoil)
			* Applied as the Center of Pressure/Lift (CP/CL)
			* Counteracts the Weight
			* _Relative Wind_ is parallel to the flight path in the opposite direction
				* Pretend that the aircraft is fixed in position
			* _Leading Edge_ (airfoil) where the wind hits the airfoil and splits the air above and below the surfaces
			* _Trailing Edge_ (airfoil) where the wind remerges at the back of the airfoil
			* _Chord Line_ (airfoil) the line drawn between the leading and trailing edge
			* _Angle of attack_ (airfoil) the angle between the chord line and the relative wind
			* Lift is always perpendicular to the relative wind.
			* Proportional to speed of aircraft and angle of attack
				* Faster speed or increase angle of attack = more lift
			* Lift is governed by [[Atlas/Atomic Notes/Newton's 3rd Law\|Newton's 3rd Law]] and [[Atlas/Atomic Notes/Bernoulli's Principle\|Bernoulli's Principle]]
			* 
		* Drag
			* Always perpendicular to the lift (basically, the relative wind)
			* _Resultant Force_ (airfoil) the total lift. From vector math, subtract the drag from the true lift, I think
		* Weight
