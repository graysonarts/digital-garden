# Loading and Performance

- 3 axes of rotation
	- Roll is tilting left and right
		- Aeleron. On a quad, right stick left and right
	- Pitch is tilting up and down
		- Elevator. On a quad, right stick up and down
	- Yaw is panning left and right
		- Rudder. On a quad, left stick left and right
	Power on a quad is left stick up and down, and that controls elevation
		For fixed wing, power is forward thrust
* Flight Forces
	* Summary of Forces
		* Fixed Wing
			* Lift is force applying "up" on the aircraft
			* Weight is the force applying "down". gravity
			* Thrust is force created by the primary engine. Prop or Jet
			* Drag is wind resistance opposite thrust
		* Quad (rotorcraft)
			* Lift is created by the motors
			* Weight is gravity
			* Thrust is when we tilt the quad in a direction, thrust is created in that direction
			* Drag is wind resistance opposite thrust
## Forces

### Lift
* Quad - Produced by the motors
* Fixed - created by the wing (airfoil)
* Applied as the Center of Pressure/Lift (CP/CL)
* Counteracts the Weight
* _Relative Wind_ is parallel to the flight path in the opposite direction
	* Pretend that the aircraft is fixed in position
* _Leading Edge_ (airfoil) where the wind hits the airfoil and splits the air above and below the surfaces
* _Trailing Edge_ (airfoil) where the wind remerges at the back of the airfoil
* _Chord Line_ (airfoil) the line drawn between the leading and trailing edge
* _Angle of attack_ (airfoil) the angle between the chord line and the relative wind
* Lift is always perpendicular to the relative wind.
* Proportional to speed of aircraft and angle of attack
	* Faster speed or increase angle of attack = more lift
* Lift is governed by [[Atlas/Atomic Notes/Newton's 3rd Law\|Newton's 3rd Law]] and [[Atlas/Atomic Notes/Bernoulli's Principle\|Bernoulli's Principle]]
### Drag
* Always perpendicular to the lift (basically, the relative wind)
* _Resultant Force_ (airfoil) the total lift. From vector math, subtract the drag from the true lift, I think
* 2 types of drag
	* _Parasite Drag_ by product of flying through the air
		* As speed increases, parasite drag increase.
		* Three types of Parasite drag
			* _Form Drag_ the shape of an object (e.g. Truck vs sports car)
			* _Interference Drag_ increased drag created by the junction between different objects
			* _Skin Friction_ any imperfections on the surface of the lift generating object (propeller, wing, etc)
	* _Lift Induced Drag_ 
### Weight
* Result of gravity
* Applied as center of gravity. This is different than the center of pressure/lift.
* Always points to center of earth
* Every aircraft has a maximum allowable weight to be able to leave the ground.
	* If exceeded, no flight
### Thrust
* Created by the propeller
* A Propeller is just an airfoil and creates lift using the same principles as a wing.
* In a quad, thrust is only created when the quad is banked, otherwise, it's creating only lift
* Trust > Drag = Accelerating
* Drag > Thrust = Decelerating 
* Drag == Thrust = Consistent speed
* If Thrust == 0 then Drag == 0, meaning you aren't moving
