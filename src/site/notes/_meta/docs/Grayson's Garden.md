# Welcome to my Garden

This is my attempt to [Learn in Public](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public). Sometimes it's tech, sometimes it's art, sometimes it's writing or filmmaking. It's all a journey, and this documents that journey.

You can read about my [[!Core System/Core System\|Core System]] for productivity. As someone with ADHD, it can be hard to get things done, so I try to systematize as much as possible.

I am slowly moving this Garden over from my previous attempt at having a garden. I want to bring my Garden into my main vault now supported using [Obsidian Digital Garden Plugin](https://dg-docs.ole.dev/) instead of the various ways I was doing it before.

# Who am I?

I'm [Grayson](https://graysonarts.com), a [software consultant and Fractional CTO](https://grayson.llc), [Filmmaker/producer](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm6722099/), [Aerialist](https://www.instagram.com/graysonaerialarts), [Nutrition Coach](https://nutritiongay.com) and [Actor](https://www.tcmmodels.com/talent-men/2615356/grayson-h). Yes, I clearly have ADHD.
