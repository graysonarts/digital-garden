# Vault Organization Quick Reference

## PARA Structure Overview

### 0-Inbox
- New captures and ideas
- Process daily to appropriate PARA folders

### 1-Projects
- Active work with deadlines (2-week to 3-month timeframe)
- [[1-Projects/+MOCs/Projects Dashboard\|1-Projects/+MOCs/Projects Dashboard]] - Navigation hub
- Client Work, Creative, Technical subfolders

### 2-Areas
- Ongoing responsibilities requiring regular attention
- [[2-Areas/+MOCs/Areas Dashboard\|2-Areas/+MOCs/Areas Dashboard]] - Navigation hub
- Business Development, Creative Practice, Health & Fitness, Technical Skills

### 3-Resources
- Reference material organized by topic
- [[3-Resources/+INDEX\|3-Resources/+INDEX]] - Navigation hub
- Creative Coding, Film & Photography, Nutrition & Fitness, Rust Development, Screenwriting, Technical, Web Clippings

### 4-Archives
- Completed/inactive items
- Projects and Areas subfolders

## PARA Quick Reference

### PARA in 30 seconds
- Projects: Short-term efforts with a clear goal and deadline.
- Areas: Ongoing responsibilities with a standard to maintain.
- Resources: Reference material by topic; might be useful someday.
- Archives: Inactive items kept for reference.

### What goes where (rules of thumb)
- If it has a done state → 1-Projects
- If you must maintain it → 2-Areas
- If it’s knowledge/examples → 3-Resources
- If it’s inactive → 4-Archives
- If undecided in 30s → 0-Inbox, process later

### Lifecycles
- Project: 0-Inbox → 1-Projects → 4-Archives/Projects
- Area: evolves continuously; archive when no longer relevant
- Resource: stays in 3-Resources; rarely moves

### Folder discipline vs tags
- Folders = status/intent (P/A/R/A)
- Tags = facets (topic, energy, medium). Keep tag rules in [[!Meta/docs/Complete Tag System Documentation\|!Meta/docs/Complete Tag System Documentation]].

### Naming conventions
- Projects: Project Name – Goal
- Areas: Area – Responsibility
- Resources: Topic – Specific
- Dashboards/MOCs: prefix with `+MOCs/` and suffix "Dashboard"

### Quick triage workflow (5 min)
1) Inbox scan; do ≤2 min tasks, otherwise file to Projects/Resources
2) Projects: add next actions; archive stalled >2 weeks
3) Areas: capture maintenance tasks/metrics
4) Resources: file clips, add 1–2 tags
5) Archive: move done items immediately

### Weekly review (15–30 min)
- Projects: update statuses; 1–3 next actions each
- Areas: quick health check (green/yellow/red)
- Resources: dedupe and link related notes
- Archive: move done/cancelled items; update archived dashboards

### Linking habits
- Link up to dashboards/MOCs: [[1-Projects/+MOCs/Projects Dashboard\|1-Projects/+MOCs/Projects Dashboard]], [[2-Areas/+MOCs/Areas Dashboard\|2-Areas/+MOCs/Areas Dashboard]], [[3-Resources/+INDEX\|3-Resources/+INDEX]]
- Link sideways across related notes; add a 1‑sentence summary at top of notes

### Saved searches (suggested)
- Orphan notes: `path:"3-Resources" -file:*/+MOCs/* -[[*]]`
- Stalled projects: `path:"1-Projects" tag:#next-action -updated:2w`
- Needs triage: `path:"0-Inbox"`

### When in doubt
- Advances a goal now → Project
- Accountable over time → Area
- Might help future you → Resource
- Done/inactive → Archive

## Navigation Hubs
- [[1-Projects/+MOCs/Projects Dashboard\|1-Projects/+MOCs/Projects Dashboard]] - Active project overview
- [[2-Areas/+MOCs/Areas Dashboard\|2-Areas/+MOCs/Areas Dashboard]] - Responsibility areas
- [[3-Resources/+INDEX\|3-Resources/+INDEX]] - Topic navigation

## Topic-Specific MOCs
- [[3-Resources/Rust Development/Rust Development MOC\|Rust Development MOC]] - All Rust-related content
- [[3-Resources/Film and Photography/Photography MOC\|Photography MOC]] - Photography projects and techniques
- [[3-Resources/_Screenwriting\|_Screenwriting]] - Screenwriting craft and projects

## Migration Summary
- Atlas → Resources (organized by topic)
- Efforts → Projects/Areas/Archives (based on status)
- Clippings → Resources/Web Clippings
- Maintained emoji tagging system
- Preserved all existing metadata and links
