## ACE Quick Reference

### ACE in 30 seconds
- **Atlas**: Knowledge base and reference materials organized by topic.
- **Calendar**: Moments in time, daily thoughts, and temporal tracking.
- **Efforts**: Actions of importance organized by status and energy investment.

### What goes where (rules of thumb)
- If it's knowledge/reference → Atlas
- If it's a moment in time → Calendar
- If it's an action requiring work → Efforts
- If undecided in 30s → 0-Inbox, process later

### Effort Status Categories
- **🔥 On**: Currently active efforts requiring significant attention
- **♻️ Ongoing**: Continuous responsibilities requiring regular maintenance
- **〰️ Simmering**: Back-burner initiatives needing occasional attention
- **😴 Sleeping**: Inactive efforts, potential future work
- **✅ Archive**: Completed efforts kept for reference

### Lifecycles
- Effort: 0-Inbox → Efforts/🔥 On → Efforts/♻️ Ongoing → Efforts/✅ Archive
- Atlas content: stays in Atlas; rarely moves
- Calendar: temporal organization; archive old entries

### Folder discipline vs tags
- Folders = status/intent (ACE categories)
- Tags = facets (topic, energy, medium). Keep tag rules in [[!Meta/docs/Complete Tag System Documentation\|!Meta/docs/Complete Tag System Documentation]].

### Naming conventions
- Efforts: Effort Name – Goal/Outcome
- Atlas: Topic – Specific
- Calendar: Date-based naming
- Dashboards/MOCs: prefix with `_` and suffix "Dashboard"

### Quick triage workflow (5 min)
1) Inbox scan; do ≤2 min tasks, otherwise file to Efforts/Atlas
2) Efforts: add next actions; move between status folders as needed
3) Atlas: file clips, add 1–2 tags
4) Archive: move done items to Efforts/✅ Archive immediately

### Weekly review (15–30 min)
- Efforts: update statuses; 1–3 next actions each
- Atlas: dedupe and link related notes
- Archive: move done/cancelled items; update archived dashboards

### Linking habits
- Link up to dashboards/MOCs: [[Efforts/_Efforts Dashboard\|Efforts/_Efforts Dashboard]], [[Atlas/_Resources Index\|Atlas/_Resources Index]]
- Link sideways across related notes; add a 1‑sentence summary at top of notes

### Saved searches (suggested)
- Orphan notes: `path:"Atlas" -file:*/_* -[[*]]`
- Stalled efforts: `path:"Efforts" tag:#next-action -updated:2w`
- Needs triage: `path:"0-Inbox"`

### When in doubt
- Advances a goal now → Efforts/🔥 On
- Accountable over time → Efforts/♻️ Ongoing
- Might help future you → Atlas
- Done/inactive → Efforts/✅ Archive

## Navigation Hubs
- [[Efforts/_Efforts Dashboard\|Efforts/_Efforts Dashboard]] - All efforts by status
- [[Atlas/_Resources Index\|Atlas/_Resources Index]] - Knowledge base navigation
- [[Calendar/Journal\|Calendar/Journal]] - Daily journaling and reflection

## Topic-Specific MOCs
- [[Rust Development MOC\|Rust Development MOC]] - All Rust-related content
- [[Photography MOC\|Photography MOC]] - Photography projects and techniques
- [[_Screenwriting\|_Screenwriting]] - Screenwriting craft and projects

## Migration Summary
- PARA → ACE framework transition complete
- Atlas → Knowledge base (formerly Resources)
- Efforts → Actions organized by status (formerly Projects/Areas)
- Maintained emoji tagging system
- Preserved all existing metadata and links
