*****I will do my best to (a) follow the processes documented here; and (b) on a regular basis evaluate these processes and update the document to better reflect what's working and what's not, as well as what's important to me and what's not**

# The Root

## Morning Journal
I spend 30 minutes writing in my journal every morning. I use [DayOne](https://dayoneapp.com/) as my journaling platform and I use my mac laptop or e-ink tablet for writing the journal entries for the day.
## Timeblocking
I have been using [Akiflow](https://web.akiflow.com/referral?name=R3JheXNvbg%3D%3D&referral=2dwES7IErDhUANfT) (affiliate link) for my planning and todo list management system. It supports timeblocking with the ability to setup the work block and then drag tasks into it. I find this process amazingly easy to implement and helps me plan out themes for the day and sections of the day.
## Morning Work
I work on the most important thing that I need to get done first thing in the morning
## Morning Exercise
I spend at least 30 minutes of moving every day when I need a break from the morning work, usually around 9:30am during the week, and less regimented on the weekends. On days when I have energy, I use chatGPT and Hevy to plan out a 75 minute lifting routine. My goal is 4 days of lifting a week.
## During The Day
**Capture** - I capture ideas into the day notes on obsidian and I keep a pocket notebook with me to capture new things that come into life.
**Simplify** - I strive for inbox-zero every day creating tasks as they come in from email. I have to check both my personal email (gmail) and protonmail for business.
**Organize** - I use the GTD methodology for tracking work in progress augmented with Kanban's WIP limits to enable me to balance commitments and learn to say "no" when I'm overloaded. I will try to ensure that everything has a deadline associated with it to help with executive function. I will hold deadlines as sacred.
**Reflect** - I review my projects, goals, and areas of focus on a regular cadence, At least weekly.

## Shutdown Ritual
I log my hours in [Harvest](http://try.hrv.st/4-899152) for each client, consolidating time entries for the day into larger chunks to accurately capture the work completed

For every incomplete task/goal/project, I ensure that there is a next action logged for each project. I schedule the next follow up for each project

For every relationship I want to maintain, I review the last time I communicated with them and schedule the next steps into my systems.

Record 1 thing that went well and 1 thing that could be improved. Document any insecurities and mistakes that need improvement.

## Weekly Planning
On Sunday mornings, I look through my calendar for next week, and my quarter plan, and decide what needs to get down the following week.

I write down key takeaways from the week, and areas where I feel like I can work to improve.
# Keystone Habits

- Business Development - Review Projects in progress and ensure next actions are listed, preferably with deadlines.
- Personal Development - Spend 30 minutes journalling or meditating every morning.
- Body/Health Development - Move for 30 minutes every day.

# What is the System
## Why do I have a core system?
I have a core system so that I do not get stuck with my life and I can move multiple projects across personal and career goals forward on a daily, weekly, quarterly, yearly, and decadely basis.

The core system help me focus my energy, address my anxiety and fear for the future, and makes sure that nothing falls through the cracks.

## What does my core system contain?
My core system contains the core documents, and disciplines I need to move my life forward.

### Maintenance
1. I review my values once a week and create a value plan as part of weekly planning with notes about what I want to focus on that week that aligns with my values, and maybe experiments or habits I would like to implement to help keep me better aligned with my values.
2. I review my strategies once a week when doing my weekly planning. I can tweak them at any time, but I try to overhaul them once a quarter at least. If a major like change happens, I also will likely overhaul them then.
3. I maintain an idea notebook which I keep with me as much as possible. I review this notebook when I update my strategies to incorporate new ideas into my life.
