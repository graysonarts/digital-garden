## Capture

Capture is handled with multiple inboxes:
- Linear - Client Work Tasks as discovered
- ClickUp - Video Production
- Todoist Inbox
- russell.hay@gmail.com - Personal Work
- grayson@threedollarbillcinema.org - Board Work
- grayson@grayson.llc - Client Work
- grayson@tryonce.com - Specific Client Work

## Simplify and Organize

- Inbox Zero to create tasks in the inbox
- For each task in inbox
	- Categorize as any of the following:
		- Relationships
		- Maintenance
		- Business Development
		- Creative
	- Find which project it's related to, put it in that project
		- If no project, add to "upkeep" project
		- If not actionable, add to "Someday/Maybe" project
	- For each item that is not destined for Someday:
		- Is it a next action? No? Break it down into more steps. What is the next action? No need to be super granular right now.
		- Is it actionable currently? If so, done, If not, add information about why not actionable and add a link to the "waiting on" list

## Shutdown Ritual
- Reflect on your current work item, and write down next steps for where you stopped for the day.
- Reflect on what you want to improve tomorrow, and what you are proud of today.
- Get to inbox zero
- Ensure that hours are logged in Harvest
- Review CRM for next actions on relationships and move them into Todoist
