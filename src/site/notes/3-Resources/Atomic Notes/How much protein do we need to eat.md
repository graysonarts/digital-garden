# How much protein do we need to eat

The National Academy of Medicine recommends a minimum of 0.8g of protein per kilogram of body weight.[^3] This is a bare minimum. More recent research shows that up to 2.2kg per kg of body weight is tolerable for most people.[^4] For athletes, it can go even higher.

For me, at 155lbs (~70g BW), I eat between 120-180gs per day depending on the day. I skew towards the lower end on rest days, and the higher end on lifting days.
