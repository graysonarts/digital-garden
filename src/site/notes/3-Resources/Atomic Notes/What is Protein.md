# What is Protein
Proteins are the basic building blocks for a large part of our body. It makes up our organs, muscles, bones, and many of the chemicals necessary to sustain life. It's found throughout the body. It is made up of Amino Acids that are combined in thousands of ways to create the proteins necessary to repair and replace cells that die during the normal course of our lives.

Protein is most commonly associated with muscles because you need a bunch of protein to build muscles.
