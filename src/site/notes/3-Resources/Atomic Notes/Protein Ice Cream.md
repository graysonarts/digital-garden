Here is the base that I use for my [Ninja Creami](https://amzn.to/3JBrxaw).

My protein of choice currently is [PE Science](https://i.refs.cc/yTCZ0Kfr).

This makes 4 servings for me.

## Base
- 1 cup milk (I use 2% grass fed organic when possible)
- 1/2 cup low fat cottage cheese
- 2 scoops protein powder
- 1-2 tbsp no sugar pudding mix

Blend all of above together before freezing.

I usually add a splash of milk before processing in the creami for the first time, and I do the lite ice cream mode.

## Favorite flavors

### Banana Fosters
- Protein: Gourmet Vanilla
- Pudding Mix: Banana
- Add before freezing: Cinnamon
- Mix in: 1 banana for each half of the pint
Notes: I know they say don't use fresh fruit when mixing in, but I use a fresh banana. You can use frozen if you want.
