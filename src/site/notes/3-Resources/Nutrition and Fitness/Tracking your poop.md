Yeah, it's not a pretty thing, but when you have messed up digestion, sometimes you just have to do unpleasant things to figure out what's going on.

So, I'm tracking my poops using the [Bristol Stool Scale](https://www.webmd.com/digestive-disorders/poop-chart-bristol-stool-scale) so that I can try to correlate food intake and stress levels with my BMs.

Since BMs are a lagging indicator, it's hard to make correlations without it.

My tracking is simple. My goal is to stay within the 3-4 range.

| Date       | Time  | Stool Type |
| ---------- | ----- | ---------- |
| YYYY-MM-DD | HH:MM | 1-7        |
Then I can correlate out of range BMs with the food that I ate 24-48 hours prior.

Not pretty, but hopefully, I can identify what's going on.
