## Printers I'm considering add
- Something from Bambu

## Slicers
Slicers are tools used to turn models into [[G-Code\|G-Code]] to control the 3d Printer.

I use the [UltiMaker Cura](https://ultimaker.com/software/ultimaker-cura/) and Anycubic Slicer to control my printers.

## ~~Network access~~
~~I run Octoprint on a Raspberry PI 4 to run my printers. I might one day upgrade that machine, but for now, it runs the printers nicely. Sometimes, I'll connect directly to the printer if I need to.~~

## Systems of useful things to print
- Multiboard or GridFinity - Both are systems of modular organizational objects. I'm moving from GridFinity to Multiboard because I feel like it's more well-thought out and I like how solidly it fits together GridFinity requires magnets, and magnets are annoying.
- [Underware](https://www.printables.com/model/941161-underware-the-ultimate-cable-management-solution) is a cable management system built around multiboard. I'm going to be printing those once I get my home printer set back up. I also need to make sure I have white filament since that's my color of choice for my office.
- [openGrid](https://www.printables.com/model/1214361-opengrid-walldesk-mounting-framework-and-ecosystem/files) - I'm probably moving to this system for my cable management system which uses Underware style channels, but is cleaner in my opinion.
