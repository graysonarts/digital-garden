	- Basically, store vector encodings in the same vector space across all content types.
	- Pattern 3 in the above is about storing pointers to the raw file for later retrieval when your LLM is multimodal and needs access to the source data
	- If you don't need the source data, you can use Pattern 1, which is to just encode a text description. e.g. You take the image and run it through a "describe this image" and then use the resulting text for your encoding.
