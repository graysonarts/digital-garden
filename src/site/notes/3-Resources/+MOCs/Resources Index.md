Good ol' Ctrl-F has probably saved millions of hours since its invention. But what if you'd rather have something on paper, but you still need to be able to search it? I don't have a keyboard and a little display in the front of my notebooks, but I do have an index, and in a large number of cases it works nearly as well.</p>The index seems like a lost art nowadays with so many references moving online.¬†Maybe that's not so surprising: making a generally good index is quite difficult and historically has been a profession, and there's actually an organization called the American Society of Indexers. But if you just want to help yourself find stuff when you put it away in your notebook or binder, it couldn't be easier to start an index. In fact, you're the best-qualified person to make an index for yourself, because you know how you relate ideas way better than anyone else.I've found a surprising lack of resources on the Web relating to this idea, so I'm writing my own. While I've designed this guide for notebooks because that's how I use it, most of the techniques should apply to binders as well, or maybe even filing systems with a little bit of adaptation.(As a side note, the plural of index¬†as used in this article is indexes.¬†Indices¬†is a more Latin form nowadays used only in mathematical contexts.)ExamplesYou might prefer to look at these once you've read some of this guide, but if I put them at the end you might not know I had them here until you finished. I'll refer to them later on. (Click on an image to enlarge it.)</p> | <ul><li>clippings</li></ul>              | \-      |
