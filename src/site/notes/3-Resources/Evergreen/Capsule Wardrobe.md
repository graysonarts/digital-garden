# Capsule Wardrobe

A Capsule Wardrobe for a man consists of classic styles, high quality materials, and excellent construction that are tailored to fit and can be combined in versatile ways to create multiple outfits.

A Capsule Wardrobe should be minimal.

A Capsule Wardrobe should not follow the latest trends, but be based on basics.

A Capsule Wardrobe should keep to a color scheme that focuses on neutral colors. Pops of color should come from accessories.

A Capsule Wardrobe should be tailored to your personal style and lifestyle.

## What should be in a Capsule Wardrobe?

Aim for no more than 30 items in your Wardrobe, excluding workout clothes, underwear, etc.

### Bare Minimum
- A suit - Aim for a neutral color suit, 2 piece is the most versatile.
- Dark Wash Jeans
- Light Wash Jeans
- Chinos, Either Tan or Gray depending on your preference
- A pair of shorts. I opt for khaki
- A white Oxford Cotton Dress Shirt
- A light blue Oxford Cotton Dress Shirt
- A solid button-up shirt, more casual if you'd like
- 2 Plain T-Shirts. I opt for not white and not black for these, but still neutral. I like dark gray.
- 2 Solid Colored Sweaters
- Leather Dress Shoes to match your suit and chinos
- Sneakers, Ideally white or black.
- Necktie, Charcoal works best, make sure it doesn't clash with your chinos
- Leather belt, again to match your suit, chinos, and shoes
