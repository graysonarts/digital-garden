There is no such thing as "Good" foods and "Bad" foods, but there are foods that I should eat more of, and foods that I should eat less of.

This list is different for every person, so this is my personal list of foods. If a food isn't listed here, it's likely that I just don't eat it, unless it's vegetables. All vegetables are game in my world (except Avocados, and any kind of potato. those fall under other categories)
