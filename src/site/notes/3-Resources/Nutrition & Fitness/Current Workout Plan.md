**Target Stats:** 155 lbs @ 14% BF
**Timeline:** 10-12 weeks
**Training Experience:** 15 years

---

## Overview

3-day minimalist strength program using double progression, designed around aerial bungee performance schedule. Focus on strength-to-weight ratio and lean, athletic physique.

---

## Training Schedule

**Weekly Pattern:**
- **Monday:** Lower Push + Adductors
- **Tuesday:** Aerial Bungee
- **Wednesday:** Upper Push/Pull
- **Thursday:** Aerial Bungee
- **Friday:** Lower Pull + Posterior Chain
- **Saturday:** Active Recovery (mobility/stretching)
- **Sunday:** Aerial Bungee

**Session Duration:** 35-45 minutes
**Daily Walking:** 30+ minutes (including treadmill desk work)

## Double Progression Protocol

**How it works:**
1. Each exercise has a rep range (e.g., 3 sets of 5-8 reps)
2. Add reps each week until you hit the top of range on ALL sets
3. Once you hit target (e.g., 3x8), add weight and drop back to bottom of range
   - **Upper body:** +5 lbs
   - **Lower body:** +10 lbs
4. If form breaks down or shoulder hurts, reduce weight immediately

**Example Progression:**
- Week 3: 225 lbs √ó 5, 5, 5
- Week 4: 225 lbs √ó 6, 6, 5
- Week 5: 225 lbs √ó 7, 7, 6
- Week 6: 225 lbs √ó 8, 8, 8 ‚Üê Top of range achieved
- Week 7: 235 lbs √ó 5, 5, 5 ‚Üê Added 10 lbs, restart

**Deload:** Every 4th week, reduce volume by 40% (2 sets instead of 3, or -20% weight)

**Monitoring:**
- Log every session: date, exercise, weight, reps
- Track shoulder feeling (1-10 scale)
- Weekly bodyweight (Monday AM)
- Energy levels

**Deload Schedule:**
- Week 7: Deload
- Week 11: Deload (if needed)

## Nutrition Framework

### Daily Targets
- **Protein:** 140-160g (PRIORITY #1)
- **Calories:** ~2000-2200 (don't track obsessively)
- **Hydration:** 100+ oz water daily

### Protein Distribution
**Target:** 35-40g per meal √ó 4 meals

**Sources:**
- Chicken, fish, lean beef
- Eggs, Greek yogurt
- Protein powder

### General Guidelines

**‚úÖ PRIORITIZE:**
- Vegetables with every meal (volume, satiety, nutrients)
- Whole food carbs around training (rice, potatoes, oats)
- Healthy fats in moderation (avocado, olive oil, nuts)

**‚ùå ELIMINATE/MINIMIZE:**
- Liquid calories (soda, juice, fancy coffees)
- Alcohol (impacts recovery and fat loss significantly at 48)
- High-processed snacks

### Weekly Check-In
- **Weigh Monday mornings** (same conditions)
- **Target:** 0.4-0.5 lbs loss per week
- **If not losing after 2 weeks:** Slightly reduce portions
- **If losing faster than 0.75 lbs/week:** Add more food (preserve muscle)

---

## Recovery Protocol

### Sleep
**Target:** 7-8 hours minimum
- Critical at 48 for recovery and fat loss
- Prioritize sleep hygiene

### Mobility Work (Saturday/Sunday)
**Duration:** 10-15 minutes

**Focus Areas:**
- Hip flexors and adductors (for aerial and squats)
- Thoracic spine (for shoulder health)
- Ankle mobility (for squat depth)

---

## Shoulder Management Protocol

### Traffic Light System

**üü¢ Green Light (No Pain):**
- Progress normally

**üü° Yellow Light (Slight Discomfort):**
- Stay at current weight for 2 weeks
- Add reps slowly
- Increase face pulls/shoulder health work

**üî¥ Red Light (Sharp Pain):**
- Immediately reduce weight by 10-20%
- Rebuild slowly
- Consider exercise substitutions

### Exercise Substitutions
- Incline press ‚Üí Landmine press or floor press
- Overhead work ‚Üí Keep light and controlled, never maximal
- Add extra face pulls and band work when shoulder feels "off"

## Key Principles

### The 48-Year-Old Athlete Mindset
**Consistency beats intensity.**

1. Show up 3x/week, no heroics
2. Hit protein target daily
3. Sleep well
4. Let aerial work handle conditioning
5. Progress weights slowly but steadily

### Not Trying To:
- ‚ùå Break records
- ‚ùå Train to failure every set
- ‚ùå Add excessive volume
- ‚ùå Look like a bodybuilder

### Trying To:
- ‚úÖ Build sustainable strength
- ‚úÖ Support aerial performance
- ‚úÖ Get leaner progressively
- ‚úÖ Move better at 48
- ‚úÖ Achieve gymnast-like physique

---

## Expected Outcomes (Week 12)

- **Bodyweight:** ~155 lbs
- **Body Fat:** ~14%
- **Strength:** Measurable increases on all main lifts
- **Aerial Performance:** Improved power-to-weight ratio
- **Recovery:** Better movement quality, managed shoulder health
