**Phase 1 (Months 1-3):** Foundations

- Gesture drawing
- Construction methods
- Basic proportions
- Landmark identification

**Phase 2 (Months 4-6):** Anatomical Understanding

- Skeletal structure
- Major muscle groups
- Form rendering

**Phase 3 (Months 6-12+):** Application and Stylization

- Transition to shounen styles
- Develop personal voice
- Portfolio building

### The Layering Exercise

**Core Practice Method for Month 4:**

**Exercise: Anatomical Layering (30 min per body part)**

**Steps:**

1. **Layer 1 - Skeleton (10 min):**
    
    - Draw only bones for body part
    - Get proportions and angles right
    - Establish structure
2. **Layer 2 - Muscle Groups (10 min):**
    
    - On new Procreate layer or separate drawing
    - Add major muscles one at a time
    - Use different colors for each muscle
    - Show origin and insertion points
3. **Layer 3 - Surface Form (10 min):**
    
    - On new layer
    - Draw skin surface showing muscle forms underneath
    - Add flesh, fat, basic shading
    - Show only what's visible on surface
4. **Repeat 5-10 times same body part in same session**
    
    - Internalizes the layering
    - Builds muscle memory
    - Each rep gets faster and more confident

**Example Progression (Arms):**

```
Session 1: Just bones (humerus, radius, ulna)
Session 2: Bones + deltoid only
Session 3: Bones + deltoid + biceps
Session 4: Bones + deltoid + biceps + triceps
Session 5: Full arm with all muscles + surface
```

> [!tip] Digital Layer Workflow In Procreate:
> 
> - Layer 1: Skeleton (30% opacity, lock)
> - Layer 2: Muscles (50% opacity, lock after)
> - Layer 3: Surface (100% opacity)
> - Toggle visibility to see relationships

### Month 4 Milestones

**By Week 4, you should:**

- ✅ Understand skeletal structure
- ✅ Identify major muscle groups without reference
- ✅ 150+ hours total practice
- ✅ Draw muscular male torso from imagination (recognizable even if imperfect)

**Investment Recommendation:** Month 4 is perfect time to invest in:

- **10 min:** Draw hands from imagination

**Hand Simplification: Palm Block + Cylinder Fingers**

**The Palm Block:**

- Rectangle or pentagon shape
- Slightly wider at knuckles
- Curves follow wrist
- Think of as box in 3D space

**The Fingers:**

- Each finger = 3 cylinders (except thumb = 2)
- Knuckles = joints where cylinders connect
- Taper toward fingertips
- Use perspective ellipses at joints

**Key Hand Facts:**

- **Middle finger = longest**
- **Ring and index ≈ similar length**
- **Pinky = shortest**
- **Thumb attaches LOWER, rotates differently**
- **Palm = half of hand length**
- **Fingers = other half**

**Exercise: Hand Construction Drill**

**Steps (4 minutes per hand):**

1. **Gesture (30 sec):**
    
    - Overall hand shape and direction
    - Major action line
2. **Palm block (1 min):**
    
    - Draw palm as 3D box
    - Show perspective
    - Mark knuckle line
3. **Finger cylinders (1 min):**
    
    - Add all 5 fingers as cylinders
    - Show 3 segments each (except thumb)
    - Add ellipses at joints
    - Check lengths
4. **Refinement (1 min):**
    
    - Add contours
    - Show knuckle wrinkles
    - Indicate nails
    - Refine thumb position
5. **Shading (30 sec):**
    
    - Major shadow shapes only

**Reference Resources:**

- **Handy Art Reference Tool** app ($1.99)

> [!warning] Common Hand Mistakes
> 
> - Fingers too uniform (vary lengths!)
> - Thumb wrong position (attaches lower!)
> - Palm too small (should be ~half hand)
> - No foreshortening (hands are 3D!)
> - "Banana fingers" (add knuckle bumps!)

    - URL: https://www.nma.art/videolessons/figure-drawing-i-rendering/
    - Glenn Vilppu on modeling tone

**Focus: 3-5 Major Shadow Shapes (Ignore Complex Gradients)**

**The 3-Value Approach:**

1. **Light** - where light hits directly
2. **Mid-tone** - transition areas
3. **Shadow** - areas blocked from light

**Exercise: Simple Value Studies**

**Setup:**

- Line of Action with clear lighting
- Procreate with Soft Airbrush or charcoal brush
- 5-6 figures at 10 minutes each

**Steps per figure:**

1. **Line drawing (3 min):**
    
    - Quick construction/gesture
    - Establish proportions
2. **Identify shadow shapes (2 min):**
    
    - Squint at reference
    - See only 2-3 BIG shadow shapes
    - Draw shadow edges with line
3. **Fill values (5 min):**
    
    - **Leave lights white**
    - **Fill shadows dark**
    - **Add mid-tones in transition**
    - NO gradients yet - flat shapes only

**Study How Light Reveals Form:**

- **Cylindrical limbs:** Shadow wraps around curve
- **Torso box:** Shadow on side planes
- **Sphere joints:** Shadow curves around form
- **Cast shadows:** On ground and body parts

**Form Principles:**

- Light side vs. shadow side (clear separation)
- Core shadow (darkest part where form turns away)
- Reflected light (bounce light into shadows)
- Cast shadows (object blocks light)

> [!important] Cylinder Study Before drawing full figures:
> 
> - Draw 20 cylinders at various angles
> - Show light source
> - Render with core shadow, reflected light, cast shadow
> - This is fundamental to understanding limbs

### Month 5 Milestones

**By Week 4, you should:**

- ✅ Hands recognizable and believable (not perfect, but no longer avoiding them)
- ✅ Feet recognizable and believable
- ✅ Render form with simple value structure
- ✅ 200+ hours total practice

**Test:**

- Draw hand and foot from imagination
- Add basic shading
- Should look 3D and structurally sound

**Exercise: Cylinders in Perspective Mastery**

**Part 1: Pure Cylinder Practice (10 min):**

- Draw 20 cylinders at various angles
- Show ellipses at both ends
- Show foreshortening (far end smaller)
- Show cross-contour lines indicating rotation

**Part 2: Limb Studies (30 min):**

- Draw 10 limbs (arms or legs) with extreme foreshortening
- Start with cylinder construction
- Add anatomy on top
- Practice: arm punching toward viewer, leg kicking forward, etc.

**Part 3: Full Figures (30-40 min):**

- Draw 4-6 full figures with foreshortened elements
- Use Quick Poses app for dynamic references
- Focus on exaggerating tilt, lean, twist, foreshortening

**Dynamic Pose Priorities:**

1. Strong gesture (clear action line)

6. **Drawing 6:** Full shounen style with dynamic posing

**Focus Areas for Shounen:**

- **Dynamic poses** - exaggerated action
- **Strong silhouettes** - clear readable shapes
- **Energy lines and motion effects**
- **Clean shape language** suggesting muscle vs. rendering detail

**Technical Practice:**

- Draw 10 action poses (punch, jump, run, kick, etc.)
- First pass: Realistic anatomy
- Second pass: Simplified to shounen clarity
- Focus on MOVEMENT over accuracy

### Digital Layer Strategy for Style Study

**Procreate Workflow:**

**Layer 1 (20% opacity):** Realistic construction

- Accurate proportions
- Proper anatomy
- Reference structure

**Layer 2 (100% opacity):** Stylized version

- Exaggerated proportions
- Style-specific features
- Modified anatomy

**Toggle between layers** to see exactly how you're modifying proportions.

**Save progression files** showing your development over time.

### Months 7-9 Milestones

**By Month 9, you should:**

- ✅ Draw recognizable figures in bara, yaoi, OR shounen styles
- ✅ Understand how each style modifies realistic anatomy and WHY
- ✅ 400+ hours total practice
- ✅ Portfolio pieces in target style(s)

---

## Months 10-12+: Style Integration and Personal Voice

#personal-style #integration #mastery #portfolio

**Focus:** Integrate multiple style influences, develop unique voice

## Measuring Progress and Success Metrics

#progress-tracking #milestones #self-assessment

### Monthly Self-Assessment Checkpoints

**Create Standard Test Battery (Every 30 days):**

**90-Minute Test Session:**

1. **5 gesture drawings** (30 seconds each) - 2.5 min total
2. **3 proportion drawings** (5 minutes each) - 15 min total
3. **2 anatomical drawings** with muscle emphasis (10 min each) - 20 min total
4. **1 value study** with shading (20 minutes) - 20 min total
5. **1 imagination drawing** (30 minutes, no reference) - 30 min total

**Total:** 87.5 minutes

**Archive these tests:**

- Date each test clearly
- Compare current month to previous month
- Note specific improvements
- Identify remaining challenges

### The Digital Overlay Accuracy Check

**Procreate Method:**

1. Draw figure on Layer 1
2. Place reference image on Layer 2 at 50% opacity
3. Create Layer 3 in red
4. Mark errors on Layer 3:
    - Proportion errors (measure differences)
    - Angle errors (shoulder, pelvis, limbs)
    - Anatomy mistakes
5. Count error types
6. Focus next month on most common error category

### Quantitative Metrics to Track

**Monthly Tracking (Spreadsheet or Notebook):**

|Metric|Goal|Actual|
|---|---|---|
|**Total practice hours**|40-60 hours|___|
|**Total drawings created**|300+ gestures|___|
|**Days practiced**|20+ days|___|
|**Average session length**|30-60 min|___|
|**Topics studied**|(list)|___|

**ADHD Benefit:**

- Tracking creates accountability
- Checking boxes provides dopamine
- Visual progress is motivating

### Success Indicators by Month

**Month 1 Success:**

- ✅ Complete 30-second gestures without freezing
- ✅ Understand line of action concept
- ✅ Identify 5 major landmarks
- ✅ Log 10+ practice hours
- ✅ Create 300+ gesture drawings

**If missing:** Need more gesture volume—increase daily session count/duration

**Month 3 Success:**

- ✅ 1-minute gestures show movement not stiffness
- ✅ Construct figures from basic shapes believably
- ✅ Identify ribcage and pelvis
- ✅ Log 50+ hours
- ✅ Complete 500+ gestures

**If missing:** Likely not using construction method enough—dedicate full sessions to building from shapes

**Month 6 Success:**

- ✅ 5-minute drawings show form and gesture integrated
- ✅ Proportions within 5% accuracy
- ✅ Name and draw 10 major muscle groups
- ✅ Draw recognizable hands and feet (not perfect)
- ✅ Log 100+ hours
- ✅ Complete 1,000+ gestures
- ✅ Draw somewhat believable figure from imagination

**If missing:** Anatomy study insufficient—increase focused anatomy sessions, use 3D app more

**Month 12 Success:**

- ✅ Quick gestures consistently capture essence
- ✅ Complex poses approachable
- ✅ Can teach basic concepts to others (proves understanding)
- ✅ Developing unique style
- ✅ Log 300-500+ hours
- ✅ Produce professional-looking work

**If missing:** Likely too much exploration, not enough deliberate practice—return to structured drilling

### Warning Signs Requiring Course Correction

**After 3 months, if 30-second gestures still not fluid:**

- **Problem:** Overthinking, trying for accuracy too early
- **Solution:** Speed challenge—draw same pose 20 times with decreasing time (5 min → 30 sec). Focus on single flowing line ONLY.

**After 6 months, if figures still look flat without dimension:**

- **Problem:** Insufficient form and value practice
- **Solution:** Dedicate 2 weeks exclusively to cross-contour line studies and 3-value rendering. Every drawing MUST show cylindrical limbs and box-like torso.

**After any period, if same mistakes repeat without improvement:**

- **Problem:** Deliberate practice missing—mindlessly repeating without analysis
- **Solution:** After EACH drawing, spend 2 minutes identifying what went wrong, hypothesize correction, test in next drawing immediately. This is the **testing effect**—core of deliberate practice.

**If constant overwhelm and practice avoidance:**

- **Problem:** Task breakdown insufficient
- **Solution:** Make tasks absurdly small—commit to drawing just 3 circles for "warm-up." Often leads to full session. Use 5-minute rule aggressively. Reduce session to 15-20 min if needed. **Something > nothing, momentum builds.**

**If bored and unmotivated:**

- **Problem:** Too much drilling, insufficient creative application
- **Solution:** Shift ratio to 50% drills / 50% creative work. Introduce novelty—new brushes, subjects, techniques. Do style studies of favorite artists.
